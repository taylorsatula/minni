# Linguistics

Minni isn't arbitrary. The shapes encode how sounds are made.

## Vowels are open

When you say a vowel, air flows freely. Nothing blocks it. The glyphs reflect that - they use negative space, don't fully enclose.

Where the vowel happens in your mouth affects where the glyph sits:

**i** and **e** are front vowels - tongue forward. Their glyphs lean left.

**o** and **u** are back vowels - tongue pulled back. Their glyphs lean right.

**a** is low and central - mouth wide open. The glyph spreads across the baseline.

## Consonants are closed

Consonants obstruct airflow somehow. The glyphs show that closure.

**Stops** (p, t, k, b, d, g) block air completely then release. Enclosed shapes.

**Fricatives** (f, s, h, v, z) force air through a narrow gap. Angular, directional.

**Nasals** (m, n, ng) let air escape through the nose. Vented shapes, like chimneys.

**Liquids** (l, r) flow continuously. Smooth descending strokes.

## Voiced vs unvoiced

Put your hand on your throat. Say "sss" then "zzz". Feel the vibration on "zzz"? That's voicing.

Voiced consonants (b, d, g, v, z) have "feet" - grounding elements at the baseline. They're heavier because voicing adds weight to the sound.

Unvoiced consonants (p, t, k, f, s) float. No ground contact.

## The crown

Uppercase is just lowercase with a dot at the top left. A status marker, not a different shape. Same letter, marked as important.

## Numbers

Base-5 tally system. You can count them visually.

- 0 is a small diamond (void)
- 1-4 are vertical ticks
- 5 is a horizontal bar (one "hand")
- 6-9 are the bar plus ticks below

Looking at 7 you immediately see: one bar, two ticks. Five plus two.

## Why this matters

Most alphabets are historically arbitrary. Latin letters don't encode anything about the sounds they represent - they just evolved that way.

Minni shapes carry information. Front vowel? Look left. Voiced consonant? Check for feet. Once you learn the patterns, new letters become predictable.

Korean works similarly - the hangul shapes encode tongue position and airflow. It's learnable in hours instead of months because there's logic underneath.

## The grid

Everything fits 9×9 pixels. Square cells, true monospace, scales cleanly.
